        <h2 style="margin-top: 30px;">Why choose Libra?</h2>
        <p>The recent emergence of machine learning has given rise to hundreds of different frameworks, so why would you use Libra? Here's why libra outperforms all these other alternatives. </p>
        <hr>
        
        <h2>Libra priotizes ease of use and ergonomics.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Libra is a machine learning API designed for non-technical users. This means that it assumes that you have no background in ML whatsoever. </li>
            <li>Never preprocessed data before? Never worked with complex graphing libraries to analyze your models? Never understood what a dropout or a pooling layer does? Perfect. None of this knowledge is required to get your hands dirty in machine learning with Libra.</li>
            <li>This makes it very easy to test the possibility of machine learning in your work enviroment. Don't go out and hire a machine learning engineer before you know it's possible to integrate the technology in your current system. Be confident first.</li>
            <li>This ease of use does not come at the cost of reduced flexibility: all parameters that can be passed into sklearn and keras algorithms can also be passed to Libra. On top of this, we've already setup preprocessing pipelines for you to tune if you'd like!</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>

        <h2>Libra has a large community and many resources available</h2>
        <p>With a strong core team and mentorship opportunities, Libra offers many sockets to find success.</p>
        <p>Join our slack group, where the founding developers are constantly asking questions about the library.</p>
        <p>If you're an organization, fill out our form today and we'll hold either live or online instruction on how to use our tools.</p>
        <hr>
        
        <h2 id="keras-makes-it-easy-to-turn-models-into-products">Libra is the nexus of modern machine learning</h2>
        <p>We've combined technologies from the most popular platforms to create a complete experience</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Keras's model building techniques for improved modularity</li>
            <li>TensorFlow's core computational power</li>
            <li>PyTorch's Acceleration for optimization and efficiency</li>
            <li>Sklearn's one-line approach to building and training models</li>
            <li>Keras Tuner's intelligent neural network tuning strategies</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        
        <h2>Libra makes collaboration between experience levels possible</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The API can be used by a complete novice, without modifying any parameters.</li>
            <li>It can also be used by a moderately experienced developer, who understands the basics of the process.</li>
            <li>It can also be used by a machine learning engineer, who understands the details of all the parameters offered by the library</li>
            <li>This allows for users of all sorts of experiences collaborate on the same task.</li>
        </ul>
